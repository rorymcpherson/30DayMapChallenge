# #30DayMapChallenge

**Kia ora!** This year I'm participating in the **#30DayMapChallenge** by creating a series of interactive web maps using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. Each day in November I intend to publish a new web map based on the daily theme. I'm excited to use this challenge as an opportunity to advance my front-end development skills, while also leveraging content from the ArcGIS Location Platform and ArcGIS Online.

### *What is the #30DayMapChallenge?*

The #30DayMapChallenge is a month-long event that takes place every November, inviting participants to create and share maps each day based on a different daily theme. It encourages creativity and exploration of mapping and cartographic techniques using various tools and data sources. This challenge is open to everyone, whether a beginner or an expert, with the goal of promoting mapmaking and geospatial awareness across a global community.
